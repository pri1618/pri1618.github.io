Hello there!

I am a senior undergraduate at IIT Bombay majoring in Mechanical Engineering. 
My research is focused on sub-continuum heat transfer and I am deeply interested in developing thermal management systems for emerging technologies.

My bachelor's thesis under [Prof. Amit Agrawal](https://www.me.iitb.ac.in/~amit.agrawal/about.html) focuses on analytical methods for thermal transport in nanostructures under the phonon hydrodynamic framework. I previously interned at [Jaguar Land Rover](https://www.jaguarlandrover.com/) where I experimentally characterized a thermal management system for automotive traction inverters.

Besides my academics, I am a huge fan of intricate worldbuilding in science fiction and high fantasy from the likes of Brandon Sanderson and Frank Herbert.
