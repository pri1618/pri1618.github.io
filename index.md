Hello there!
I am a senior undergraduate at IIT Bombay majoring in Mechanical Engineering. My research is focused on sub-continuum heat transfer and I am deeply interested in developing thermal management systems for emerging technologies.

My bachelor's thesis under Prof. Amit Agrawal focuses on analytical methods for thermal transport in nanostructures under the phonon hydrodynamic framework. I have previously interned at Jaguar Land Rover where I worked on experimentally characterizing thermal management systems for automotive traction inverters.

Besides my academics, I am a huge fan of intricate worldbuilding in science fiction and high fantasy from the likes of Brandon Sanderson and Frank Herbert. 
Feel free to explore this website for articles on my projects and other work.
